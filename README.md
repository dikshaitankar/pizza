# pizza
I have used jquery and bootstrap for designing the page.
Used json to populate the data containing the list of pizza image, its ingredients, its name and price.
I have not worked with ajax before this and have not created database as well.
I am proficient at html(latest version), css(latest version),bootstrap(4),jquery,javascript and learning angularjs.
